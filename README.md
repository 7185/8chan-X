This is a small 8chan userscript, it adds various features and options like:
 * A fixed menu bar with customizable board list (no forced default boards)
 * Post and image counts
 * Unread post count in tab title
 * Some key bindings ('R' to reload the page, 'Q' to open quick reply, ESC to close it, CTRL+S to spoiler, etc.)
 * Image expansion on hover (threads and catalog)
 * Relative post dates (X minutes/hours/days ago)
 * Integration with the official 8chan Options menu
 * Reveal text and image spoilers
 * Use catalog links by default in the menu
 
Additionally, this fork adds:
 * Semi-dynamic menu color (more compatible with custom themes)
 * Thread page display on the catalog and in the menu status area
 * Visible autosage on the catalog and in the menu status area
 * Reverse image search links
 * Many other poorly written hacks
 * Occasional updates
